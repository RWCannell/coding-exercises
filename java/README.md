# Java Coding Exercises
A repository for exercises in the Java programming language.   

## Running Java Files
To run a `.java` file, we need to first compile the file. To compile the file, run
```bash
javac /path/to/file.java
```
After it has compiled without any errors, the file can be run with
```bash
java /path/to/file.java
```
(If using VS Code, the option to _Run_ will appear just above the `main` method).
